# Movie Uplink

This is a small application that, utilizing the TMDb API, provides movie information from the following APIs:

- Top Rated Movies
- Now Playing
- Trending Movies

After displaying the top 10 movies in the selected category, the user is able to choose to view movie details from any listed movie.

One major goal for the project was to explore the [Uplink](https://uplink.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library which simplifies creating HTTP API clients.
